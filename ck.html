                    The history of early Christianity covers the period from the origins of Christianity to the First Council of Nicaea in 325.<br>

                    Early Christianity may be divided into two distinct phases: <b>the apostolic period</b>, when the first apostles were alive and led the Church, and the post-apostolic period, when an early episcopal structure developed, and persecution was periodically intense.<br> The Roman persecution of Christians ended in AD 324 when Constantine the Great decreed tolerance for the religion. He then called the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325, beginning the period of the first seven ecumenical councils.<br>

                    The earliest followers of Jesus were Jewish Christians who formed an apocalyptic, Second Temple Jewish sect.<br> This Jewish sect also included Gentile God-fearers, which posed a problem as they could not fully observe the Halakha.<br> Due to this inclusion of Gentiles, Early Christianity gradually grew apart from Judaism during the first two centuries of the Christian Era; it established itself as a predominantly gentile religion in the Roman Empire.<br> Although Paul's influence on Christian thinking is said to be more significant than that of any other New Testament author, discussion of his relationship with Judaism continues.<br>

                    In the Ante-Nicene Period (literally before Nicaea), following the Apostolic Age, several trends emerged simultaneously.<br> One unifying trend was an increasingly harsh rejection of Judaism and of Jewish practices. By the beginning of the Nicene period, the Christian faith had spread throughout Western Europe and the Mediterranean Basin, and to North Africa and the East.<br>
