                    Islam arose within the context of Late Antiquity.<br> The second half of the sixth century saw political disorder in Arabia, and communication routes were no longer secure.<br> Religious divisions played an important role in the crisis.<br> Judaism became the dominant religion of the Himyarite Kingdom in Yemen after about 380, while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf.<br> While much of Arabia remained polytheistic, in line with broader trends of the age there was yearning for a more spiritual form of religion.[21] Many were reluctant to convert to a foreign faith, but those faiths provided intellectual and spiritual reference points, and Jewish and Christian loanwords from Aramaic began to replace the old pagan vocabulary of Arabic throughout the peninsula.<br> On the eve of the Islamic era, the Quraysh was the chief tribe of Mecca and a dominant force in western Arabia.To counter the effects of anarchy, they upheld the institution of "sacred months" when all violence was forbidden and travel was safe.<br> The polytheistic Kaaba shrine in Mecca and the surrounding area was a popular pilgrimage destination, which had significant economic consequences for the city.<br>

                    According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570.<br> His family belonged to the Quraysh. When he was about forty years old he began receiving what Muslims regard as divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel, which would later form the Quran. </font></center>
